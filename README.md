Scope
- Block-level vs function-level scope
- `let` and `const` are block-scoped

Let and Const
- `let` allows reassignment
- `const` creates immutable bindings

Arrow Functions
- Shorter syntax
- Do not bind their own `this`

Array Methods
- `map`: transforms array values
- `filter`: keeps values that meet a condition
- `reduce`: accumulates array to single value
- `forEach`: iterates over elements

Objects
- Key-value pairs
- Can contain methods

🖥️ Deliverables
- `presentation-console-demo.js`: Examples for each topic
- `array-demo.html + array-demo.js`: Web UI to demonstrate array methods
